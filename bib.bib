abstract = {The frequently used approach to the comparison of two linear regression models is to use the partial F test. It is pointed out in this paper that the partial F test has in fact a naturally associated two-sided simultaneous confidence band, which is much more informative than the test itself. But this confidence band is over the entire range of all the covariates. As regression models are true or of interest often only over a restricted region of the covariates, the part of this confidence band outside this region is therefore useless and to ensure 1-N1 simultaneous coverage probability is therefore wasteful of resources. It is proposed that a narrower and hence more efficient confidence band over a restricted region of the covariates should be used. The critical constant required in the construction of this confidence band can be calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. While this two-sided confidence band is suitable for two-sided comparisons of two linear regression models, a more efficient one-sided confidence band can be constructed in a similar way if one is only interested in assessing whether the mean response of one regression model is higher (or lower) than that of the other in the region. The methodologies are illustrated with two examples.}

 abstract = {A frequently encountered problem in practice is that of simultaneous interval estimation of p linear combinations of a parameter N2 in the setting of (or equivalent to) a univariate linear model. This problem has been solved adequately only in a few settings when the covariance matrix of the estimator is diagonal; in other cases, conservative solutions can be obtained by the methods of Scheffe, Bonferroni, or Sidak (1967, Journal of the American Statistical Association 62, 626-633). Here we investigate the efficiency of using a simulated critical point for exact intervals, which has been suggested before but never put to serious test. We find the simulation-based method to be completely reliable and essentially exact. Sample size savings are substantial (in our settings): 3-19% over the Sidak method, 4-37% over the Bonferroni method, and 27-33% over the Scheffe method. We illustrate the efficiency and flexibility of the simulation-based method with case studies in physiology and marine ecology.},

@book{mc_book,
title = "Multiple comparisons using R",
abstract = "Adopting a unifying theme based on maximum statistics, Multiple Comparisons Using R describes the common underlying theory of multiple comparison procedures through numerous examples. It also presents a detailed description of available software implementations in R. The R packages and source code for the analyses are available at http://CRAN.R-project.org After giving examples of multiplicity problems, the book covers general concepts and basic multiple comparisons procedures, including the Bonferroni method and Simes' test. It then shows how to perform parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear models and general parametric models. It also introduces the multcomp package in R, which offers a convenient interface to perform multiple comparisons in a general context. Following this theoretical framework, the book explores applications involving the Dunnett test, Tukey's all pairwise comparisons, and general multiple contrast tests for standard regression models, mixed-effects models, and parametric survival models. The last chapter reviews other multiple comparison procedures, such as resampling-based procedures, methods for group sequential or adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple comparison procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling multiplicity in experiments ensures better decision making and safeguards against false claims. A self-contained introduction to multiple comparison procedures, this book offers strategies for constructing the procedures and illustrates the framework for multiple hypotheses testing in general parametric models. It is suitable for readers with R experience but limited knowledge of multiple comparison procedures and vice versa.",
